# Cryptography Programs

This repository contains Java and Python programs for various cryptography topics.
Topics Covered

   * XOR
   * Caesar Cipher
   * Substitution Cipher
   * Vigenere Cipher
   * Hashing Functions
   * Block Ciphers
   * Stream Ciphers
   * RSA

## Getting Started

To run any of the programs in this repository, you'll need to have the appropriate language installed on your computer. The Java programs require the latest version of Java, which you can download from Oracle's website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). The Python programs require Python 3, which you can download from Python's website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have the required language installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

      ```git clone https://github.com/CyberPrudent/Cryptography.git```

## Running the Programs

To run any of the programs in this repository, navigate to the appropriate directory and run the program using the appropriate command. For example, to run the XorCrypt program in the Java directory, you would navigate to the java directory and run the following command:

      ```java XorCrypt```

## Central-Dogma-Hash-Algorithm

Finally, If you're interested in learning about more advanced hashing algorithms, check out the Central-Dogma-Hash-Algorithm. This algorithm was developed as part of a team project and is significantly more complicated than this example as we made sure to create a hashing algorithm from scratch that is one-way and with a low probability of collision. You can try out the Central-Dogma-Hash-Algorithm for yourself on our project website at https://andrew-musa.github.io/cpsc329/.
